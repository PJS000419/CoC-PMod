They are covered in fine muddy-brown scales, some are dotted with the muck of their kin. Their long, spindly fingers and toes end in wicked-looking claws, while they are wingless and have a prehensile tail, though you can’t see any sign of spines on their tail ends. They snap their jaws intermittently but mostly are content to let their draconic tongues flop out, almost as long as they are tall, and allow thick green slime to drool copiously from their gaping maws. They switch positions constantly, and the ones who aren’t busy, take some time to make out and laugh at you teasingly.";
